# Optimal-Solution-for-Typical-Transportation-Problem

**Optimal Solution for the Typical Transportation Problem** project is aiming at the complexity of agenda distribution through applying the latest algorithms to optimize the overall cost and to minimize the fuel expenses. Containing such as advanced optimization methods, the project plan will be designed to generate an **Initial Basic Feasible Solution (IBFS)** for transport problems. This procedure comprises encompassing numerous algorithms such as the **Northwest Corner Rule, Column Minimum Method, Row Minimum Method, Least Cost or Matrix Minima Method, and Vogel's Approximation Method** that facilitate drawing a possible distribution plan. The project is developed along the IBFS process, and it implements **iterative optimization techniques** in order to find the best solution of the distribution plan, which takes into account the supply and demand constraints while minimizing the costs.


Another aspect of the project is its emphasis on usability and this is done by featuring symbols and signs, error handling mechanisms, and charts and graphs for the transportation table and solution. The overall goal of this mini-project is to proffer an effective and practical solution to distribution issues. By doing this, we will be contributing to the field; our solution will be reflective of a practical and efficient approach to transportation.
